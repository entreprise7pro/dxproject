# dxproject

This project requires entreprise7pro/dxbase https://github.com/entreprise7pro/dxbase (from packagist) which brings in the wxt distribution along with carefully curated core patches and also contrib modules that are very good to use with wxt.
A lot of attention to detail and work was done to ensure that these items help build a very strong site.

so in this dxproject you can fork it and put your own stuff in, custom modules, config, whatever.

features: helpful installation setup for splash (if you have one) 
          configuring split settings in settings.php, configuring user/psw for db in settings.php.
